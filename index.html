					<p>There have been many Jedi from many different parts of the galaxy however, there have been cases 
						in the order where there has only been one idividual who has represented their speicies in it.
						One example of this is was a tusken raider who was discovered to be force sensitive and so trained to become a jedi
						and even lived on after order 66.

                    <p>Many years before the republic we see in episode 1 of the star wars movies, there was a great war where the Jedi fought against the mandolorians. tarre vizsal, the first mandolorian jedi, created a light saber, later named the dark saber
						which we see used through out this war after her death by her clan and has since been passed down the generations.

					<p>The jedi believed that you should be always in the moment and not worry about the future. 
						This was the belief that made Jedi Sifo Dyas afraid of the order because he had the ability to see vivid and accurate visions of the future
						throught the force. He would have shared these visions because he thought they could help the order however ultimatly decided not to becasue he 
						learned about a prison called the citadel where the jedi sent people like Sifo Dyas who dared to speak about the future. This is just on of 
						the jedi's beliefs that caused their downfall as they were too arrogent in their own power to even consider there may have been dangerous threats in the future.
